### Restaurant manager application built using React
this is my first project created with React🎉

![restaurant_website](https://github.com/corsall/restaurant-react-client/blob/main/restaurant-react-app.png)

React client was built to consume ASP.NET CORE Web API with Axios.
- You can create, retrieve, update, delete rows. Of course, if you have permission 😎.
- If you want to change the data, try to create an account. No real email or phone number needed haha😊
- Of course, only a user with the admin role can delete lines
- Client and api work with each other via 🔑 JWT tokens, where needed
- 🔍There is a Search bar for finding rows by content.
- You can change the table you want to work with. (There are 5 tables)

#### Demo: https://corsall.github.io/restaurant-react-client/

Feel free to test the website, but be careful 🚨 only admin can delete everything you created.🚨

This project was part of another project where I tested my api skills. Over time, the project grew and now is in a separate repository.

It is worth noting that the client relies heavily on the API and without a server there will be no data that can be displayed, so the client will be an empty window
If you are interested, here is the repository with the api on which this client works.
what a surprise api also has a mini client so be sure to check it out❤️
